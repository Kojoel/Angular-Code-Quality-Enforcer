### Linting Formatting Practice

### Project Description

- About
  This project focuses on improving code quality in an Angular application by integrating ESLint and Prettier. It involves configuring ESLint, adding custom rules, fixing linting errors, and documenting fixes. It also involves integrating Prettier for consistent code formatting and automating both tools using npm scripts and pre-commit hooks.

After running the 'npm run lint' command, the following errors were detected:

```
D:\Amalitech Frontend Labs\ANGULAR\Angular-Code-Quality-Enforcer\src\app\app.component.ts
  15:3   warning  Lifecycle interface 'OnInit' should be implemented for method 'ngOnInit'. (https://angular.dev/style-guide#style-09-01)  @angular-eslint/use-lifecycle-interface
  23:17  warning  Missing semicolon                                                                                                        semi
  24:19  warning  Missing semicolon

  âœ– 3 problems (0 errors, 3 warnings)                                                                                                      semi
```

- The first warning was fixed by adding 'implements OnInit' to the App Component Class and importing OnInit in the component.
- The last two warnings were fixed by placing a semi-colon at the ends of the statements made on line 23, and line 24;
  Running 'npm run lint' after fixing the errors did not generate any further errors.
